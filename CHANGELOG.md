-   changed empty fields warning and now indicate which ones by decorating their label
-   improved the way the best spellcasting entry the staff spellcasting entry will be based on is chosen
    -   it first looks at the ones with the highest DC, if only one is found, then we are done
    -   if only one has the same attribute than the character's main classDC, then it will be chosen
    -   it will then look at the one with the most "prepared" spells
    -   if it still ends up with a tie between multiple entries, the first of them will be picked

    -   the character needs to be able to cast spells, the module uses `Items Only - All Magic Items`, `Prepared` and `Spontaneous` spellcasting entries to determine that
    -   the character will have the opportunity to expend a prepared spell to add extra charges during daily preparations
    -   the character will have the opportunity to expend a spontaneous spell slot while casting a spell from a staff
